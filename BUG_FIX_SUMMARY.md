# Juggl Plugin Crash Fix - Summary

## Problem Description
The Juggl plugin was crashing when creating new files in Obsidian with the following error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'group')
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug Pattern
1. User creates a new file in Obsidian
2. The file-open event fires immediately
3. The metadata cache is not yet populated (returns null)
4. The plugin tries to add this null node to the Cytoscape graph
5. Cytoscape internally calls `.group()` on the null object
6. Plugin crashes with TypeError

### Key Discovery
The error was occurring in the workspace-mode and local-mode file-open event handlers, which were attempting to add null nodes to the visualization without checking if the node data was valid first.

## The Fix

### 1. Added null checks in workspace-mode.ts
```typescript
const node = await this.view.datastores.coreStore.get(id, this.view);
if (!node) {
  console.log('[Juggl Debug] workspace file-open - node is null, skipping add');
  return;
}
```

### 2. Added null checks in local-mode.ts
```typescript
const nodeDef = await this.view.datastores.coreStore.get(id, this.view);
if (!nodeDef) {
  console.log('[Juggl Debug] local-mode onOpenFile - nodeDef is null, skipping add');
  this.viz.endBatch();
  return;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced existing protections
- Added vizReady checks in metadata change handlers
- Added null checks in various event handlers (mouseout, tap, mouseover, etc.)
- Added defensive checks for view objects in forEach loops

## Files Modified
1. `/src/viz/workspaces/workspace-mode.ts` - Added null check after getting node data
2. `/src/viz/local-mode.ts` - Added null check after getting node definition
3. `/src/obsidian-store.ts` - Enhanced vizReady and null checks
4. `/src/viz/visualization.ts` - Added defensive checks in event handlers

## Why Previous Attempts Failed
- Initially focused on the `.group()` call location, but it was actually inside Cytoscape
- Added null checks in event handlers, but the error happened before those handlers
- The "returning empty cache" log message was the key clue that pointed to the real issue

## Lessons Learned
1. Always validate data before passing to third-party libraries
2. When dealing with async file operations, metadata may not be immediately available
3. Following the exact sequence of console logs is crucial for debugging race conditions
4. The error location isn't always where it appears - it can be in library internals

## Testing
After applying the fix, creating new files in Obsidian no longer crashes the plugin. The plugin now gracefully handles the case where file metadata is not yet available.
